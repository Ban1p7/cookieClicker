# cookieClicker
A basic cookie clicker game made in java using the swing library. Please don't blame me for my bad OOP skills.

You click on the left button for points, and the below counter will update. Upon reaching 20 points, you can buy an autoclicker, which will add one point every so often. Basically, click more times to buy more autoclickers.

This was made using the built-in swing framework in the JDK. If you have that, you can compile the code and run it if you want. Just install the JDK, clone this repository, go into the folder and run in a terminal:

javac main.java
javac cookie.java
javac autoClicker.java
javac addClicker.java
java main

This should open up a window with it in. Have fun wasting your time playing this bad game.
