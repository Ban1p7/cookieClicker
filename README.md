# What is this?
A basic cookie clicker game made in java using the swing library. Please don't blame me for my bad OOP skills.

You click on the left button for points, and the below counter will update. Upon reaching 20 points, you can buy an autoclicker, which will add one point every so often. Basically, click more times to buy more autoclickers.

# Installation:<br>
  <strong>Linux</strong><br>
    Install the JDK, clone this repository, go into the folder and if you're on linux, run build.sh with `bash build.sh`. This shouldn't vary much based on your distribution.<br>
  <strong>Windows</strong><br>
    Install the JDK, clone this repository and enter it in powershell usnng `cd /location/of/clone`. Then run `cat build.sh` and run the commands that are printed.<br>
  <strong>MacOS</strong><br>
    I don't have this OS, so good luck. I'd assume there's a terminal of some sort that you can compile it on, but I'm not too sure.<br>

This should open up a window with it in. Have fun wasting your time playing this bad game.
